      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

      <p>This interactive web application is designed as a Company Comparison Dashboard focused on two key industry players: Netflix (Streaming/Content) and Nvidia (AI/Compute).</p>
      <p>The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate an effective non-linear, user-driven exploration model suitable for novice or first-time investors. Instead of viewing a static, linear slide show, the user is empowered to navigate key research areas—such as Financials, Leadership, and SWOT Analysis—in any order they choose, ensuring a comprehensive and personalized learning experience.</p>
      <p>The entire project is built using self-contained HTML and CSS files, creating a cohesive, professional, and fully responsive user interface.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>

      <p>The dashboard is specifically tailored for a Novice Investor who is just beginning the research process. The content is summarized, highly visual, and designed to simplify complex financial and strategic concepts, reducing the feeling of being overwhelmed by data.</p>

      <h2>Key Features & Navigation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dashboard Hub (index.html):</strong> The landing page serves as the control center, featuring a series of large, clearly labeled, and clickable icons.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Linear Navigation:</strong> Each icon (e.g., Leadership, Financials) is hyperlinked to a dedicated comparison page.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Buttons:</strong> Every content page includes direct links back to the main Dashboard Hub and forward to the Final Recommendation, maintaining intuitive flow without relying on the browser's back button.</li>
        <li><strong>Side-by-Side Comparison:</strong> All content pages utilize a responsive, two-column layout for easy, direct comparison between the two companies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Use the Dashboard to jump to Financials, Timeline, SWOT, Products, Leadership, Analyst Reports, or the Final Recommendation.</div>
